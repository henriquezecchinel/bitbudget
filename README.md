# BitBudget

#### !! Work in progress !!

## The progression of this project is temporarily halted due to a strategic realignment of priorities.

Since this is initially a personal project, the application has been developed based on _'Ship First, Improve Later'_ concept, so the project can be used in a real-world scenario, and proper improvements can be implemented. Considering this, many things are not done properly, like the database migrations, the tests, the CI/CD, etc.

---

The goal of this project is to be a Budget Control App, where you can add your incomes and expenses, define goals and manage your finances.

Once released, this application is going to be running on `AWS Elastic Beanstalk`, using `AWS RDS` for the database and `AWS Secrets Manager` for the database credentials.
